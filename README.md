  **About MOSSI**

The cryosphere, an integral component of our planet's geological system, comprises regions of the globe where water exists in a frozen state. It occupies a pivotal role within the context of global climate dynamics, exerting profound influences on various elements of the world's climate system. These influences encompass the modulation of the planet's albedo through alterations in the extent of solar radiation reflection, as well as intricate interplays within broader atmospheric and oceanic circulation realms. In recent times, the cryosphere has undergone marked transformations in response to escalating climate change impacts, thereby initiating a reciprocal relationship wherein these transformations, in turn, wield a substantive impact on the global climate regime. Among the manifold constituents of the cryosphere, sea ice and ice sheets emerge as salient components that collectively span substantial expanses of the world's surface. Although these cryospheric components are distinctive in nature, they exhibit a profound interdependence, further magnifying their significance in the context of climate research. Recognizing the paramount importance of these components, concerted research efforts have been dedicated to comprehending and modeling their intricate behaviors and dynamics. Nevertheless, the task of modeling sea ice and ice sheets entails a multitude of formidable mathematical challenges, many of which are inherently shared. These challenges emanate from the intricate nature of the interactions between these cryospheric elements and other components of the global climate system, coupled with the exigencies of navigating the intricate spatial and temporal scales that underlie their complex behaviors.

**Aim of the workshop**

This workshop brings together mathematicians and geophysicists to exchange knowledge, build a common foundation for the mathematics of sea ice and ice sheets and to discuss and address the key modelling challenges.
